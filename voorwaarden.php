            I am in my mother’s room. It’s I who live there now. I don’t
            know how I got there. Perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle
            of some kind. I was helped. I’d never have got there alone. There’s
            this man who comes every week. Perhaps I got here thanks to him.
            He says not. He gives me money and takes away the pages. So many
            pages, so much money. Yes, I work now, a little like I used to,
            except that I don’t know how to work any more. That doesn’t
            matter apparently. What I’d like now is to speak of the things that
            are left, say my good-byes, finish dying. They don’t want that. Yes,
            there is more than one, apparently. But it’s always the same one
            that comes. You’ll do that later, he says. Good. The truth is I
            haven’t much will left. When he comes for the fresh pages he brings
            back the previous week’s. They arc marked with signs I don’t under-
            stand. Anyway I don’t read them. When I’ve done nothing he, gives
            me nothing, he scolds me. Yet I don’t work for money. For what
            then? I don’t know. The truth is I don’t know much. For example
            my mother’s death. Was she already dead when I came? Or did
            she only die later? I mean enough to bury. I don’t know.", "voorwaarden"));
